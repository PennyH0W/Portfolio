        <p>Web development has been a passion of mine ever since I began my journey after receiving my Webmaster Certificate from St. Petersburg College (SPC) in 1991. During that time, I had the opportunity to design websites, including both front-end and back-end components, for clients such as Performance Plus Marine, The Elks, and Hunter's Bill Collection Agency. While these sites are now considered legacy, they marked the beginning of my deep dive into the world of web development..</p>

        <p>Although I returned to healthcare to fulfill my passion for helping others regain their function and independence, I never lost my love for technology. This dual focus allowed me to balance my commitment to improving the quality of life for others with my enthusiasm for technological innovation.</p>
        <hr class="custom-hr">
        <p>In December 2023, I rekindled my interest in web development after receiving my BAS Degree in Technology Development and Management with a Cybersecurity Subplan, also from SPC. This time, Iâ€™m incorporating the cybersecurity skills I gained during my studies, blending them with my web development expertise to create secure, scalable, and innovative solutions.</p>
